PROJECT OPTION:
  option 2.

INTRODUCTION:
  In general, the program is getting data from api for OMDb and Twitter, gather the   information, process data, and then output the results of processing data to the output file. User can use it to get data about the movies and directors they are interested for. The program doesn’t require input. However, users can change the movies they want to search for by appending the movie name in the list variable “movie_names” in main function. The output of the program is a text file with information about the movies and twitter data about the directors of the movies. It creates a database with three tables: Movies, Tweets, and Users. Those tables contain information about movies, tweets, and users respectively. 

 The program has two classes. Class movie contains information about movies. An instance of Movie represents one movie we are testing about. Class Tweet contains information about the tweets of one query phrase. An instance of Tweet represents all information about one certain query phrase. For example, information about one director, and the director’s name in this case is the query word. 

RUNNING INSTRUCTION:
  run the file called “206_final_project.py”
  terminal input: python 206_final_project.py 
  Notice: Since the tweets retrieved may have special characters, the output file may have special characters. Not all applications on all computers work for the text file. It would be better to use Sublime Text Editor or Chrome to open the output text file if possible.

DEPENDENCIES:
  Modules used in this program(Please install before running):
    61unittest
    61tweepy
    61requests
    61json
    61sqlite3
    61collections
    61re

  Files needed to get data from twitter API:
    61“twitter_info.py”: a twitter authentication file. It should include consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret.
  
FILES INCLUDED:
  No additional files need to be included for this program to run, except the modules and “twitter_info.py” mentioned above.

  The program generates:
     61“206_fp_output.txt”: contains all the output
     61“206_final_project_cache.json”: contains all the cached data retrieved from API
     61“movies_twitters.db”: contains three tables

FUNCTIONS:
  61Name:  get_movie_data
   Input:  Required:  a string: movie_name that the user wants to search about
           Optional:  none
   Return Value:  dictionary movie_data that contains about the movie in the input
   Behavior:  The function takes in a string of a movie name that the user wants to search about, and use OMDb’s api to get information about the movie. Information include title, directors, actors, released date, writes, languages, etc. All data are cached in the cached file. A dictionary containing those information are returned by the function.

  61Name:  get_data_from_twitter
   Input:  Required:  string word that is the query to be searched in the API.
           Optional:  none
   Return Value:  dictionary twitter_data that contains information about the tweets related to the query in the input
   Behavior: The function takes in a query word to search in the twitter’s API and get tweets information. Information include poster screen name, poster id, tweet text, tweet favorite counts, tweet retweeted counts, etc. Data are retrieved by api.search(). All data are cached in the cached file. A dictionary containing all tweets information are returned by the function.

DATA MANIPULATION:
  First Query:
  The program find all posters who posted tweets that mentioned the directors of the movies in the list, and among those who are popular (favorited by more than 5000 people). The program outputs this information in the output file, and it helps user know who likes to talk about the movies. 

  Second Query:
  The program finds tweets that are tweeted more than or equal to 3 times, and it gets the movies that the director related to the tweets directs and outputs the title of the movie, the number of languages of the movie, and what those languages are to the output file. It is useful for people who are interested in watching the movie to check if there is a version that’s in their language. 

  Third Query:
  Among all tweets that are retweeted more than favorited, it finds tweets that are retweeted from others, and get ride of the RT prefix of the tweets. It shows only the contents of the retweeted tweets on the output file. This information informs users the popular topics about the directors and the movies.

  Fourth Query:
  It filters all tweets that have more than 0 favorites. It groups all tweets that satisfies the requirement into groups by the movie that the director(which the tweets is about) directs. The user is able to see all tweets related to each movie that has ever been favorited. This helps the user know more information about the movies, and it’s particular useful because it filters out the tweets that people don’t think are useful or interesting.   
 
REASONS FOR CHOOSING THE PROJECT:
  This project seems interesting, because I will get data from two different databases, and gather the information together to make them make sense. I will get data about the intersection, and use data retrieved from one database to search for more data in the second database. It is very practical, and the same technique can be applied to many applications in the future. I am also interested in the OBDb database.
