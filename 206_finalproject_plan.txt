Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?
 
I will choose number 2. 

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?

It will be called the Authors, which stores the authors of the articles from the national park¡¯s website.  

And by the instruction of the project, I will create a class called NationalPark. 

* What will that class take as input to its constructor?

Authors takes in a beautiful soup object.

The class NationalPark accepts an HTML-formatted string as input, and uses BeautifulSoup data parsing to access the data you want and store it in instance variables.

* What will 1 instance of this class represent?

Authors will represent one author. 

An instance of the class NationalPark will represent a bunch of the information that I got from the websites for one national park. It helps me process all the information needed. 

* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

The street address
the state
the contact number
The description of the park

* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?

get_street_address

and get_contact_number

- What will the method do?

get_street_address will use the html style string and use beautiful soup to process it. It will return a beautiful soup object. And it will save all the street_address in a variable called addresses. 

get_contact_number will use a html style string and process it using the beautiful soup. It will save all the contact numbers in a variable called contact_numbers, and it returns a list of the number. 
 

- Will it take any additional input? 

No. But I will create a beautiful soup object. 

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

get_street_address will return a beautiful object which contains the results from the processing. 

get_contact_number will return a list of the contact numbers. 

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

It will enable me to get in data and the information we need.

the function get_street_address will give me the information about the address of the national park. 

ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
print_park

- What will the method do?
It will gather all the information about one national park, and print it in a certain format.

- Will it take any additional input? 
No. It will use the information generated by the other functions in the class. 

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

It won¡¯t return anything. But it will output all information got by all other functions in the class. 

It won¡¯t change anything about the instance or instance variable.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

It will print out all the information, so the user will be able to learn about the park. Also, it helps check all the information are gathered correctly. 

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?

One table will be all the national parks. And one table will be all the articles. The other table will be all the authors. 


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)

Parks:
- text park name (primary key)
- text address
- text contact number
- text state
- text description

Author:
- text author name
- int an id for the author(primary key)
- number number of articles
- text representative articles
- text a brief introduction

Articles:
- text article name
- int an id for the article (primary key)
- text author(s)
- text a short description about the topic or the content


* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")
one: 
I will join the table author and articles:
I will get a short introduction of the author, the articles she/he wrote, and the brief description of the articles. So I will gather the last part of the Author table, the third part of Author table, and the last part of the Article table.  

the other:
I will join the Parks table and the Articles table:
I will get the name, address, and the state of the park, and all the articles that¡¯s about the park, and all the descriptions of the articles. 

* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 

I plan to use the beautiful soup methods to get certain information based on a structured html string.

I also plan to use regex to get information.

I will use list comprehension and set comprehension. 


* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

I will use the beautiful soup and regex on getting address, state, descriptions, etc about the park, articles, authors, etc.

I will use the list comprehension and set comprehension on getting the information like address, state, descriptions about the parks, articles, and authors, etc and create a list or set. I will then use the list and set to access the information about one certain park, article, or author. 


* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

It will be a .json file. It will contain a list of the parks and the information about it(address, state, contact number, descriptions, etc). It will also contains list of the articles and a list of the authors. It will contain all the other information necessary for authors and articles as well.
